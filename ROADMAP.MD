# Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned features and milestones for the PyJobSnake project.

## Milestone 1: Basic Job Crawling and Parsing

- [ ] Create the basic project structure
- [ ] Implement web crawlers for popular job platforms
- [ ] Develop parsers to extract relevant information from job listings
- [ ] Store job listings in the database
- [ ] Build a simple command-line interface for executing the crawler and parser

## Milestone 2: Database Querying and Filtering

- [ ] Implement database query functionality to fetch job listings based on various criteria (e.g., location, job title)
- [ ] Build filtering capabilities to refine search results based on specific requirements
- [ ] Enhance the command-line interface to support querying and filtering operations

## Milestone 3: User Interface and Visualization

- [ ] Develop a web-based user interface for interacting with the job listings
- [ ] Design and implement job listing visualization features (e.g., charts, graphs)
- [ ] Enable user authentication and authorization for secure access to the application

## Milestone 4: Automated Job Updates and Notifications

- [ ] Implement periodic job crawling and update mechanisms
- [ ] Set up notifications to alert users about newly added job listings matching their preferences
- [ ] Provide options for subscribing to email or push notifications for job updates

## Milestone 5: Advanced Features and Enhancements

- [ ] Implement advanced search functionalities (e.g., fuzzy search, advanced filters)
- [ ] Incorporate machine learning techniques for job recommendation or classification
- [ ] Integrate with external services (e.g., job application platforms, resume builders)
- [ ] Gather user feedback and iterate on the application's features and usability

This roadmap provides a high-level overview of the planned features and milestones for the PyJobSnake project. The timeline and specific details may evolve as development progresses.
